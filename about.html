  <title>One of a Kind</title>
 
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>y name is Ana Landeza, a senior graduating in the spring from Eastern Washington University. My field of study is Marketing and Human Resources, while also obtaining a minor in Visual Communication Design. My dream is to work for a non profit organization by helping them raise funds through benefit concerts. I have always wanted to work with musicians and this way I can help other while doing what I love. </p>

<p>My hobbies are video games, lifting, volleyball, playing my ukulele, meditation, and reading books. I want to be more outdoorsy as a person, so this year I&#39;ve made it my goal to spend money on more experiences, like hikes, fishing, traveling, and camping. I love watching movies and listening to music, no country though. I love sitting around with a good group of friend having a beer talking about life and where we would like to end up as our lives move forward. </p>
